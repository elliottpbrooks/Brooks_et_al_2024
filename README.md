## This Repository is structured by figure number refering to the paper in which these analyses are published and the supplemental figure of the same number. 

For example, 'figure_1' contains files related to figure 1 and supplemental figure 1. More detailed anatomy of each subdirectory can be found in the README.md files within each figure. But, in summary:

- figure_1: Morphometric and functional assay analysis done adult Nkx2.2 alpha cell KO mice and thier pancreatic islets.
- figure_2: Nkx2.2 alpha cell KO in vivo sorted alpha cell bulk RNA-seq and comparison to previoulsy published Nkx2.2 beta cell KO RNA-seq.
- figure_3: NKX2.2 binding assays in alpha cells and comparison to NKX2.2 binding in beta cells and transcription factor motif analysis within NKX2.2 binding sites.
- figure_4: NKX2.2 and KLF4 binding in alpha cells at Irx2 and Mafb promoters, NKX2.2 binding in Klf4 knockdown alpha cells
- figure_5:
- figure_6

!!This repo is currently being developed, thus some subdirectories for certain figures may not be available in full, yet!!
